<a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank" title="mcmaster pt admission">The McMaster Physiotherapy Program</a> understands that many future applicants to the Program may be impacted during their <strong>Winter 2020</strong> studies term <strong>due to <u>COVID-19.</u></strong> <br>Students at many institutions have been given the option of selecting a pass/fail grade over a letter/number grade and we encourage future applicants to consider <br>how this decision may impact their application to graduate programs in the future. Please review the following information in regards to how COVID-19 may impact <br>applicant’s pre-requisite courses and sub-GPA for the Physiotherapy Program:


<p>Pre-requisite Courses: The Program will still require an eligible course with a letter/number grade of at least <<br>>a B+, 77% or 3.3/4.0 for each of the four pre-requisite courses. <br>Unfortunately, we cannot accept a course with a grade of ‘pass.’ <br>Each application cycle, applicants have until December 31st to complete their pre-requisite courses.</p>

<img src="pt.jpg" width="600">
<p>Sub-GPA: Courses with a grade of ‘pass’ will not be included in an applicant’s sub-GPA calculation, <br>which is the same process as in previous and current admission cycles. <br>If an applicant has any courses with a grade of pass in their last 60 units of study, <br>grades/courses may need to be extracted beyond the last 60 units completed in order to calculate their sub-GPA. <br>For more information on how your sub-GPA is calculated, <br>we encourage you to review the information posted on the ORPAS website:</p>
