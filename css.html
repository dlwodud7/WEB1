<h2>CSS이란 무엇인가???</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.[1] <br>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

<br>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] <br>This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, <br>and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

<br>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, <br>in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
